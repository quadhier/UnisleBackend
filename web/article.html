                <p> The Maiden lay athwart the Warrior, her arms widespread as if to embrace him. The Mother seemed
                    almost to shudder as the flames came licking up her face. A longsword had been thrust through her
                    heart, and its leather grip was alive with flame. The Father was on the bottom, the first to fall.
                    Davos watched the hand of the Stranger writhe and curl as the fingers blackened and fell away one by
                    one, reduced to so much glowing charcoal. Nearby, Lord Celtigar coughed fitfully and covered his
                    wrinkled face with a square of linen embroidered in red crabs. The Myrmen swapped jokes as they
                    enjoyed the warmth of the fire, but young Lord Bar Emmon had turned a splotchy grey, and Lord
                    Velaryon was watching the king rather than the conflagration. Davos would have given much to know
                    what he was thinking, but one such as Velaryon would never confide in him. The Lord of the Tides was
                    of the blood of ancient Valyria, and his House had thrice provided brides for Targaryen princes;
                    Davos Seaworth stank of fish and onions. It was the same with the other lordlings. He could trust
                    none of them, nor would they ever include him in their private councils. They scorned his sons as
                    well. My grandsons will joust with theirs, though, and one day their blood may wed with mine. In
                    time my little black</p>
